# install_script
This is very old script dated 2009 year and nowadays many thing i'll write in another way ;)

Installation shell script for software based on:
* Java 
* JBoss
* PostgreSQL

Script using Dialog utility which help to create nice user interfaces in shell scripts and provides a set of customizable curses widgets.

Dialog rpm package and archive intall.tar.gz (which contains other necessary packages and backups) locates in the body of this script and extracted in runtime.

Software repositories do not used in this script, because script used with minial CentOS install and without Internet access. 

This script wroted in cooperation with [Vyacheslav Gmir] (https://github.com/GmirV)
